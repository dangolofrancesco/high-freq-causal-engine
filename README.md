# High-Frequency Causal Pair-Trading Engine (HF-CPTE)

HF-CPTE is a high-performance quantitative trading framework designed to identify and exploit non-linear causal relationships between financial assets. Unlike traditional cointegration-based pair trading, this engine leverages Causal Discovery algorithms to detect lead-lag relationships in high-frequency data (HFT), aiming to predict short-term price movements of a "follower" asset based on the "leader" asset's signals.

The project is built with a production-first mindset, prioritizing computational efficiency, rigorous statistical validation, and modern software engineering practices required by hedge funds and open-source organizations.
